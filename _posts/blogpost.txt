ValueOps takes it even broader and by focussing on providing value to your customer which in a why enriches and adds value to their offerings and services makes that value returns to you be it in revenue, co-cretaed event, code commits or partnering together to help eachother to achieve their goals. Vale can mean a nummerous of things, reducing costs for example can be one of them. Taking your customer by the hand to help them get the most out of your services can be another, be it in support, finance, contract management, sales, marketing all departments need to work together to help to add value to their customers.
